"Ultimate answer"
In Douglas Adams's science fiction "a guide to the galaxy", a group of highly intelligent aliens specially built a supercomputer - "deep thought" to calculate in order to find the ultimate answer to life, the universe and anything. "Deep thinking" took 7.5 million years to calculate and verify, and the final answer is "42".
Example code:
```otne
func main print "42";
func main TerminalScreen "42";
函数 主码 终端屏幕 "42";
```

"Hello, universe" example code:
```otne
func main print "Hello, universe";
func main TerminalScreen "Hello, universe";
函数 主码 终端屏幕 "你好，宇宙";
```

Otne intensive syntax:
```otne
FuncMainPrint"Hello,Universe";
FuncMainTerminalScreen"Hello, universe";
函数主码终端屏幕"你好，宇宙";
```
